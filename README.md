# Shadow Keep: The Lost Veil

Welcome to **Shadow Keep: The Lost Veil**, a thrilling survival-type game inspired by games like *Survivor.io*. Test your skills, strategy, and reflexes as you battle waves of increasingly dangerous enemies in an endless fight for survival.

## Gameplay

In **Shadow Keep: The Lost Veil**, hordes of enemies continuously attack you. Each wave grows progressively more challenging, requiring quick thinking and agile movement to survive. Your goal is simple: **kill as many enemies as possible to achieve the highest score**.

## Objective

While the game is designed to be endless, there is a special milestone:
